# Hide9
Hides all the content that belongs to 9GAGGER bot or promoted content.

## How does it work?

It clicks "I don't like this" for you.
That's all...

This is the best way, thanks to the awful coding from 9gag.com.

It also adds an icon that lists all hidden posts, if you wish to open them later on:<br>

Promoted content doesn't have a title, therefore, it doesn't show on.<br>
(The real post name and preview will show in the list.)

## Issues:

- **Some posts aren't hidding**<br>
    Can't figure out why it doesn't scan some posts.<br>
    I've added a crappy double-checking but doesn't always work.<br>
    Click on the `â‹®` menu and it should remove the post.

- **Pressing <kbd>J</kbd> doesn't go to the next post**<br>
    Blame 9gag for it.

- **The preview is missing/broken**<br>
    Long posts with text and multiple images have a different URL.<br>
    I'm too lazy to figure it out...
