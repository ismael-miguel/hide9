# Hide9
Hides all the content that belongs to 9GAGGER bot or promoted content.

## How does it work?

It clicks "I don't like this" for you.
That's all...

This is the best way, thanks to the awful coding from 9gag.com.

## Issues:

- **Some posts aren't hidding**<br>
    Can't figure out why it doesn't scan some posts.<br>
    I've added a crappy double-checking but doesn't always work.<br>
    Click on the `â‹®` menu and it should remove the post.

- **Pressing <kbd>J</kbd> doesn't go to the next post**<br>
    Blame 9gag for it.

- **The list of posts doesn't close when you click outside**<br>
    I'm too lazy to fix it.

- **The preview is missing/broken**<br>
    Long posts with text and multiple images have a different URL.<br>
    I'm too lazy to figure it out...
